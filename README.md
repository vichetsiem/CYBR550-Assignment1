# CYBR550-Assignment1
Simple UDP client â€“ server application, where a server transmits a file to a client after the client successfully logs in by using a password

In this Lab 1 Exercise, you will implement a simple UDP-based client-server system with limited security features. This Lab 1 has two objectives: (i) help you get familiarized with Linux socket programming; (ii) experiment with packet sniffing and pcap analysis using Wireshark; practice the fundamentals of TCP/IP communications and handshake; and (iv) prepare you to tackle the next Lab assignment which involves the design of a more secure client server system.
